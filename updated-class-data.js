    lore: 'Pyrofiends channel the flames of the infernal realms in battle. These fire-wielding fiends have formed pacts with demonic entities of flame, gaining the ability to channel infernal fire. They might be sorcerers who bargained with fire demons, cursed pyromancers infused with hellfire, or volatile mages born with infernal flame in their veins. Their personality and behavior tend to be fiery ‚Äì bold, reckless, and aggressive.',
    playstyle: 'Pyrofiends are momentum-based casters who walk a fine line between immense damage output and self-harm. They build up Inferno through smaller spells, which both empowers their magic and imposes growing drawbacks. As Inferno builds, they can unleash devastating abilities but risk burning themselves out.

They might be known as traveling troubadours or court musicians whose performances inspire courage, heal wounds, charm onlookers, or even sow chaos with dissonant chords. Their presence on the battlefield is announced by stirring melodies or commanding rhythms.',
    playstyle: 'Minstrels use a musical combo system built on Western music theory. Spells generate "notes" classified as Tonic, Subdominant, or Dominant. Casting spells in sequence builds musical tension, and then finishing on a Cadence resolves it for a powerful effect.

    lore: 'Chronarchs are rare guardians of the timeline ‚Äì scholars or warriors who have learned to tap the hidden currents of time. They might be known as temporal weavers, time-benders, or chronomancers, but their identity is clear: they command seconds and centuries alike. Chronarchs see time as a tangible force; their magic feels like watching moments ripple or rewind.',
    playstyle: 'Chronarchs use Action Points (AP) to act quickly, Mana to fuel magic, and their signature resource Continuum (the Time Meter). By building up Continuum through spells and movement, a Chronarch hits special thresholds (Momentum, Echo, Stasis), unlocking potent time effects.

    shortDescription: 'A trickster-class spellcaster who weaponizes randomness itself, conjuring unpredictable magic and manipulating probability.',
    lore: 'Chaos Weavers are trickster-class spellcasters who weaponize randomness itself. Unlike disciplined wizards, Chaos Weavers embrace disorder ‚Äì their spells and effects are determined by rolling special dice tables rather than fixed formulas. They conjure unpredictable magic and manipulate probability, weaving chaotic forces into every action. The Chaos Weaver lives this ethos, thriving on chaotic surges that can reshape the battlefield or backfire spectacularly.',
    playstyle: 'Chaos Weavers use the Chaos Dice System where many spells and abilities trigger random-effect tables. When casting a chaotic spell, the player rolls on a predefined table (often d100 or d12 based) to determine the result. Each result can have positive, neutral, or negative consequences. Over time, advanced Weaver abilities can tweak these rolls to give more control over the chaos. Some abilities stack chaos tokens that can be spent to trigger massive surges or modify rolls.'

    lore: 'Fate Weavers are enigmatic arcane gamblers who twist destiny itself. They wield a mystical deck instead of a spellbook, reading suits and values like runes to shape reality. As Tricksters, they delight in chaos and chance ‚Äì one moment granting boon, the next inflicting curse. In the world of the Fate Weaver, fate is tangible and only these card-wielders can alter it. Cloaked in star motifs or gambler\'s garb, a Fate Weaver might whisper that every decision is a shuffle of the cards.',
    playstyle: 'Fate Weavers draw from a deck of mystical cards to resolve magic instead of rolling dice. Each spell requires drawing one or more cards, with the suit and value determining the effect. Hearts represent life/emotion, Clubs represent will/growth, Diamonds represent wealth/stability, and Spades represent darkness/intellect. High cards trigger especially strong effects, while low cards might weaken a spell. Fate Weavers emphasize adaptability (planning for unlikely card draws) and risk-reward play.'

    lore: 'The Gambler is a flamboyant risk-taker and master of chance on the Trickster Path. Charismatic and unpredictable, this class revels in defying odds and playing high-stakes games in every encounter. A Gambler might be a suave cardsharp, a daring duelist who bets on every draw, or a wild-eyed daredevil who literally flips coins for fate.',
    playstyle: 'The Gambler\'s mechanics revolve around games of chance. Abilities often use coin flips, dice rolls, or card draws to determine effects, with unique resources to fuel or modify those outcomes. Luck Points can be spent to influence rolls, while Risk Stacks accumulate each time the Gambler plays it risky and can later be "cashed in" for huge benefits. A key theme is wagering: the Gambler often bets AP, Mana, HP, or items before resolving an effect. Betting more can amplify the reward on a win, but a loss costs the wagered resources.'

Blessed by fanatical faith or a sacred oath, the Martyr channels personal pain into holy (or unholy) might ‚Äì their power literally comes from devotion. Their narrative theme is the noble martyrdom ideal: a champion who grows stronger by shouldering suffering for others.',
    playstyle: 'The Martyr\'s unique system turns every wound into a resource. By sacrificing HP (often as a cost for abilities), the Martyr builds up Pain Charges that fuel special effects. The Martyr can also swear Blood Vows, sacrificing HP that cannot be healed until the vow is fulfilled. Crucially, this means low-HP moments are powerful: a Martyr at 10% health might have many charges, enabling game-changing abilities.

They accumulate Lies (Heresy Points) through deceitful actions, which can be spent to enhance abilities. They can also sacrifice HP to empower abilities or restore Mana, much like a "blood magic" system. Managing Lies creates a risk-reward balance: the more the Prophet sins, the more powerful their deceitful miracles become.'

The Exorcist is most potent when actively fighting spirits or purifying corruption, creating a feedback loop where defeating dark creatures feeds your holy power, which then empowers your next banishment or blessing.'
