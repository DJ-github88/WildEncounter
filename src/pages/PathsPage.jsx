          In our TTRPG system, character creation begins with selecting a background path, which provides a foundation
          of thematic abilities. Each background represents a different approach to power and adventure, providing three
          unique abilities regardless of which class a character chooses. This separation of backgrounds from classes
          allows for diverse character combinations and playstyles.
