              <p className="flavor-text" style={{ fontStyle: 'italic', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
                The goblin lunges at you with its rusty dagger. You quickly decide to spend 2 AP to dodge, rolling to the side as the blade whistles past your ear. On your turn, you spend 2 AP to attack with your sword, rolling a 6 on your d8â€”a critical hit! The goblin shrieks as your blade finds a vital spot.
              </p>
              <p>Our combat system is built around these core principles:</p>
              <ul className="rule-list">
                <li><strong>Action Points (AP):</strong> The primary resource used for all actions and reactions</li>
                <li><strong>Nimble-style Resolution:</strong> Using the weapon/spell die for both hit determination and damage</li>
                <li><strong>Armor Soaking:</strong> Armor absorbs damage rather than making you harder to hit</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Managing AP, class resources, and armor durability</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div className="tab-section">
              <h4 className="tab-subtitle">Action Points (AP)</h4>
              <p>Action Points are the heart of the combat system:</p>
              <ul className="rule-list">
                <li>AP is determined by your initiative roll at the start of combat</li>
                <li>AP is spent on both actions (your turn) and reactions (opponent's turn)</li>
                <li>AP refreshes after both sides have completed their turns</li>
                <li>Most common actions cost 1-2 AP</li>
                <li>Managing your AP between offense and defense is crucial</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For detailed AP costs, see the Action Points tab.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="tab-section">
              <h4 className="tab-subtitle">Class Resources</h4>
              <p>In addition to AP, most abilities cost class-specific resources:</p>
              <ul className="rule-list">
                <li><strong>Mana:</strong> Used by many spellcasting classes</li>
                <li><strong>Health:</strong> Some abilities require sacrificing health</li>
                <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Used for physical abilities and special attacks</li>
                <li><strong>Class-Specific:</strong> Unique resources like Continuum (Chronarch), Inferno Levels (Pyrofiend), Blood Thresholds (Martyr), etc.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Each class has a unique resource system that defines its playstyle and tactical options.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="tab-section">
              <h4 className="tab-subtitle">Attack Resolution</h4>
              <p>When you make an attack or cast a spell:</p>
              <ol className="rule-list">
                <li>Spend the required AP and any class resources</li>
                <li>Roll your weapon or spell die (e.g., 1d8 for a longsword)</li>
                <li>A roll of 1 is always a miss. If you roll a 1, roll again - if it's 1 again, it becomes a critical miss</li>
                <li>A roll of the maximum value (e.g., 8 on a d8) is a critical hit</li>
                <li>Any other result hits and deals damage equal to the roll plus attribute modifier</li>
                <li>Target's armor reduces damage based on their Armor Score (see Armor System)</li>
                <li>Remaining damage is applied to the target's hit points</li>
              </ol>
              <p>This streamlined system eliminates separate attack and damage rolls, keeping combat fast and exciting.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="tab-section">
              <h4 className="tab-subtitle">Defense Options</h4>
              <p>When attacked, you have several defensive options if you have AP available:</p>
              <ul className="rule-list">
                <li><strong>Dodge (2 AP):</strong> Increases the attacker's miss chance by 25% (making rolls of 1-3 on a d8 miss, for example)</li>
                <li><strong>Parry (1 AP):</strong> Roll your weapon die against the attacker's roll; if higher, you negate the attack. Even smaller weapons can parry larger attacks through exploding dice (if you roll the maximum value on your die, roll again and add the result)</li>
                <li><strong>Raise Shield (1 AP):</strong> Roll a shield die to absorb additional damage</li>
                <li><strong>Armor:</strong> If you don't (or can't) use a reaction, your armor still reduces damage based on your Armor Score</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Choosing when to spend AP on defense versus saving it for offense is a key tactical decision.</p>

                As you traverse the fog-laden streets of the ancient city, your footsteps echo on the cobblestones, alerting you to the lurking dangers. A hiss from the shadows betrays the presence of a lurking rogue, and without hesitation, you unsheathe your sword, bracing yourself. You're clad in medium armor with an Armor Score of 22, which reduces damage by 1d6+2 and has a durability of 28. The rogue lunges at you with his dagger, rolling a 3 on his d4 attack die - a hit!

                The attack would deal 3 damage plus the rogue's Dexterity modifier of +2, for a total of 5 damage. However, your armor reduces the damage - you roll a 4 on your 1d6 damage reduction die and add the +2 from your Armor Score for a total reduction of 6. Since damage reduction cannot reduce damage below 0, you take no damage from the attack.

They roll a 2, for a total reduction of 3. Your attack deals 7 damage, and the rogue collapses under the severe impact of your blow.

                As the rogue lunges at you, blade gleaming in the dim light, you counter with your longsword. You roll your weapon die (1d8) and get an 8 - the maximum value! This is a critical hit. Your longsword deals 8 damage (maximum for 1d8) plus your Strength modifier of +2 for a total of 10 damage. The rogue's light armor has an Armor Score of 12, which reduces damage by 1d4+1. They roll a 2 on the 1d4, adding the +1 for a total damage reduction of 3. After armor reduction, your critical hit deals 7 damage, sending the rogue staggering backward.

                Your foot slips on loose gravel as you swing your mace, sending your attack wildly off course. You roll a 1 on your weapon die - a miss. Since it's a 1, you roll again to check for a critical miss and get another 1! This is a critical miss. You roll on the Miss Consequences table (Roll: 1d10, Result: 3) and get "Overextension." Your wild swing throws you off balance, causing you to fall prone and ending your movement for this turn. The goblin cackles as you struggle to regain your footing.

              <p><strong>Corruption Points:</strong> Characters accumulate Corruption Points (CP) through exposure to corrupting influences. Effects manifest at specific thresholds.</p>
              <p><strong>Mechanical Effects:</strong></p>
              <ul className="tab-list">
                <li><strong>5 CP:</strong> Minor physical sign (discolored veins, slightly altered eye color). Disadvantage on Charisma checks with good-aligned creatures.</li>
                <li><strong>10 CP:</strong> Noticeable physical change (skin pallor, constant chill). Vulnerability to radiant damage.</li>
                <li><strong>15 CP:</strong> Significant alteration (black veins, eyes darken). Gain darkvision 60ft if you don't have it. If you do, increase by 30ft. Disadvantage on all saving throws against divine magic.</li>
                <li><strong>20 CP:</strong> Major transformation (shadowy aura, physical deformity). Gain resistance to necrotic damage but vulnerability to radiant damage. Holy water causes 2d6 damage on contact.</li>
                <li><strong>25 CP:</strong> Complete corruption. Character becomes an NPC under the GM's control.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Lesser Restoration removes 1d4 CP. Greater Restoration removes 2d6 CP. Ceremony spell (Atonement option) removes 1d8+4 CP. Extended prayer at a major holy site removes 1d10 CP.</p>
              <p><strong>Roleplaying Tips:</strong> Gradually shift your character's personality toward darker tendencies. Develop an increasing fascination with death or dark magic.</p>

              <h4 className="tab-subtitle">5. Bloodlust</h4>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> An overwhelming compulsion to engage in combat and violence, often triggered by the sight or smell of blood.</p>
              <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Barbarian rage abilities, certain curses, magical weapons with bloodthirsty enchantments, exposure to demonic influences.</p>
              <p><strong>Mechanical Effects:</strong></p>
              <ul className="tab-list">
                <li>When you see a creature wounded (below half HP), make a DC 15 Wisdom save or be compelled to attack the nearest creature (ally or enemy)</li>
                <li>Advantage on all attack rolls while under bloodlust</li>
                <li>Cannot take the Disengage or Dodge actions</li>
                <li>Resistance to fear effects</li>
                <li>After combat ends, must make a DC 15 Wisdom save or attack the nearest object if no creatures remain</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Calm Emotions spell suppresses for 1 minute. Remove Curse spell cures if the bloodlust is curse-based. A successful DC 15 Medicine check allows a character to regain control for 1d4 rounds.</p>
              <p><strong>Roleplaying Tips:</strong> Describe an increasing heart rate, tunnel vision focused on enemies, and difficulty distinguishing friend from foe in the heat of battle.</p>

              <h4 className="tab-subtitle">6. Magical Addiction</h4>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> Dependency on magical energies, often resulting from overuse of magical items or exposure to concentrated arcane power.</p>
              <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Using more than 3 magic items simultaneously for extended periods, exposure to raw magical energy, consuming magical substances.</p>
              <p><strong>Withdrawal Timer:</strong> After becoming addicted, a character must be exposed to magic every 24 hours or suffer withdrawal symptoms.</p>
              <p><strong>Mechanical Effects:</strong></p>
              <ul className="tab-list">
                <li><strong>Stage 1 (Mild Addiction):</strong> Disadvantage on Concentration checks. Can detect magic within 10 feet automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 2 (Moderate Addiction):</strong> As stage 1, plus -2 penalty to all ability checks when not in contact with a magic item.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 3 (Severe Addiction):</strong> As stage 2, plus one level of exhaustion that cannot be removed until exposed to magic.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 4 (Critical Addiction):</strong> As stage 3, plus random magical effects occur when stressed (GM's discretion, similar to Wild Magic surges).</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Each day without using magic allows a DC 15 Constitution save to reduce addiction by one stage. Greater Restoration reduces by one stage. Wish spell cures completely.</p>
              <p><strong>Roleplaying Tips:</strong> Describe a constant craving for magical energy, fascination with magical items, and withdrawal symptoms like shaking hands or magical sparks emanating from your body.</p>

              <h4 className="tab-subtitle">7. Phobia</h4>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> An irrational and debilitating fear of a specific object, creature, or situation.</p>
              <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Traumatic experiences, certain curse effects, mind-affecting magic.</p>
              <p><strong>Common Phobias:</strong> Acrophobia (heights), Arachnophobia (spiders), Claustrophobia (confined spaces), Nyctophobia (darkness), Pyrophobia (fire).</p>
              <p><strong>Mechanical Effects:</strong></p>
              <ul className="tab-list">
                <li>When encountering the phobia trigger, make a DC 15 Wisdom save</li>
                <li>On a failed save, become frightened for 1d4 minutes</li>
                <li>While frightened, you must use your action to Dash away from the source of fear if possible</li>
                <li>If unable to flee, you have disadvantage on all ability checks and attack rolls</li>
                <li>You can repeat the save at the end of each of your turns</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Calm Emotions provides temporary relief. Remove Curse works if the phobia is curse-based. Repeated exposure therapy (successful Wisdom saves against progressively closer encounters with the phobia) can eventually cure the condition.</p>
              <p><strong>Roleplaying Tips:</strong> Develop specific reactions to your phobia triggerâ€”perhaps freezing in place, screaming, or becoming irrationally angry as a defense mechanism.</p>

              <h4 className="tab-subtitle">8. Dehydration</h4>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> A dangerous lack of water in the body, affecting physical and mental capabilities.</p>
              <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Lack of water consumption, extreme heat, certain poisons or diseases that cause fluid loss.</p>
              <p><strong>Progression:</strong> Characters without adequate water (typically 2 quarts per day, more in hot environments) must make a Constitution save (DC 10 + 1 per previous check) at the end of each day or advance one stage of dehydration.</p>
              <p><strong>Mechanical Effects:</strong></p>
              <ul className="tab-list">
                <li><strong>Stage 1 (Mild):</strong> Disadvantage on Constitution checks and saves. Thirst becomes a constant distraction.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 2 (Moderate):</strong> One level of exhaustion that cannot be removed until hydrated. Disadvantage on all physical ability checks.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 3 (Severe):</strong> Two levels of exhaustion that cannot be removed until hydrated. Speed reduced by half. Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 4 (Critical):</strong> Three levels of exhaustion that cannot be removed until hydrated. Hallucinations begin (Wisdom save DC 15 to distinguish reality). Hit point maximum reduced by half.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 5 (Fatal):</strong> Death if a DC 20 Constitution save is failed. On success, remain at stage 4.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Drinking water reduces dehydration by one stage per quart consumed (maximum one stage per hour). Create Water spell can provide emergency hydration. Goodberry provides enough hydration to reduce by one stage.</p>
              <p><strong>Roleplaying Tips:</strong> Describe cracked lips, constant thirst, headaches, and eventually confusion and desperation for any liquid.</p>

              <h4 className="tab-subtitle">9. Temporal Displacement</h4>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> A rare condition where a character becomes partially disconnected from the normal flow of time due to magical accidents or planar travel.</p>
              <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Failed teleportation spells, exposure to time-warping magic, visiting certain planes of existence, interacting with artifacts that manipulate time.</p>
              <p><strong>Mechanical Effects:</strong></p>
              <ul className="tab-list">

                <li>Aging effects (from spells or abilities) are doubled</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Greater Restoration has a 50% chance to cure. Wish spell cures completely. Time spent in an antimagic field reduces symptoms temporarily.</p>
              <p><strong>Roleplaying Tips:</strong> Describe seeing brief glimpses of past or future events, speaking about events that haven't happened yet, or reacting to things that occurred minutes ago.</p>

              <h4 className="tab-subtitle">10. Soul Sickness</h4>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> A spiritual affliction that occurs when a character's soul is damaged or partially separated from their body.</p>
              <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Near-death experiences, failed resurrection spells, attacks from soul-eating creatures, exposure to the energy of the Negative Plane.</p>

The heavy blows from the orc's axe and the gauntleted strike drive you to your knees, the impact resonating through your battered armor and jarring your bones. Each strike adds layers of fatigue, dragging you deeper into a state of vulnerability. Pinned and desperate, you attempt to raise your arms in a feeble defense, the reality of your dire situation settling in. You're not just fighting for victory now; you're fighting to survive.

                As the caravan rolls into a quiet town at dusk, your party, recognizing your exhaustion, chooses a modest inn for recovery. You're shown to your room, where the innkeeper explains the recovery process, "Roll a d8 nightly for your recovery. But beware, a roll of 1 means complications." That night, under warm blankets, you sleep deeply, desperately needing the rest. Dawn reveals you've rolled a 1, and a second roll for complications results in a 10â€”a valuable new contact is interested in your group. This contact could be an asset for your journey, offering information or aid.
              </p>
              <p className="flavor-text" style={{ fontStyle: 'italic', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
                Refreshed and intrigued by this turn of events, you discuss the potential benefits of this new ally with your companions over breakfast. While the inn stay brought unexpected developments, it also presented an opportunity to enhance your quest. The rest, though fraught with minor disruptions, proves essential, teaching you the importance of choosing where to recover wisely, as it influences not only your physical restoration but also the path of your adventures ahead.

                      In this combat system, the sequence favors the swift. Players always act first, but their initiative roll dictates the action points (AP) they have for their turn. This determines their ability to react and strategize effectively under pressure. If ambushed, players roll with disadvantage for initiative.

                    <p>To determine who goes first a group initiative is rolled, this can either be a chosen player or the sum of the pc's initiative vs. the opponents initiative roll. If any party is surprised by the attack they roll with disadvantage. If the players didn't roll individually to determine the order of combat (players first, opponents second or opponents first, players second), they roll initiative to determine how much AP they get to spend on their first turn. When the first round has ended (i.e. both parties have had their turn) another initiative roll is initiated, to determine how much AP is available that turn.</p>

As the goblin nears, you unleash a powerful slash aimed directly at him, your blade slicing through the cold air with lethal intent (Melee Attack, 2 AP - 2 AP â†’ 0 AP remaining). The metal clangs harshly against the goblin's crude armor, a sound that cuts through the howling wind.

                      Noticing a precarious patch of snow overhead, the cleric of your party, who is proficient in Nature, swiftly assesses the situation. Utilizing their expertise (Nature: Terrain Insight, 2 AP), they dislodge the snow directly onto the advancing goblins.
